<p align="center"><b>USDF - The stable coin on UniChain network </b> </center>

USDF is backed by UniFund assets in order to retain a stable value of USDF being equal to~ $1. It’s also the native token of the UniFund platform that can be used to investigate, transfer and exchange among other operations. The USDF’s smart contract can be found here: https://github.com/Unifund-De-Capital/USDF-stable-coin


<b>How USDF works.</b> <br/>
Stable coins including USDT and USDC are backed by/pegged to real assets such as gold, FIAT or even ownership shares of real estate. This is to ensure a stable value. Owners of such coins can redeem or exchange them for the asset they are backed by at any time, for example US dollars. In the case of USDF the value is tied to another stable coin, USDT. The following diagram illustrates how this works:

 <br />

<p>
1. Users/Investors request to withdraw from the UniFund platform. Currently, either USDT or USDF can be withdrawn <br />
2. USDT or USDF will be sent to users/investors wallet address<br />
3. If the request is USDT, the corresponding amount of USDF will be burnt on the UniChain via smart contract as the backed value has been withdrawn from the system <br /><br/>
